\title{Calculate eGFR by Schwartz cystatin C-based equation (for children only)}
\usage{
egfr.schwartz.cys(cystatin, cystatin_units = "mg/L")
}
\arguments{
\item{cystatin}{Numeric vector. Serum cystatin, could be expressed in "mg/L" or "nanomol/L". Units of measurement should be defined in variable cystatin_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "mg/L").}

\item{cystatin_units}{Character string. Units in which serum cystatin is expressed. Could be one of the following: "mg/L" or "nanomol/L"}
}
\value{
numeric eGFR expressed in ml/min/1.73m\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}.
}
